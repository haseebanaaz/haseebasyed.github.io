								<p>I, an Electronics and Electrical Engineering graduate, landed my first job as a Senior Analyst at the then-worldâ€™s second-largest electronics manufacturing company Flex (formerly called Flextronics) in its procurement team in India. I never knew I had a passion for data until I handled huge inventory datasets and performed root cause analysis on them. I realised I had a good sense of data handling. Ever since there was no turning back as I had found my passion. I then moved on to work for Universal Publications as an Operations Analyst where I had the opportunity to create dashboards and reports for the team on Excel. In order to move toward a more data-oriented job role that also deals with machine learning, I managed to join Amazon as Senior Data Associate in their machine learning team. It was a huge experience in terms of AI and NLP. The kind of data that never bores you. Everyday work was interesting and challenging where I could work with customer datasets dealing with shopping queries and give insights to the ML team. I got to work on several tools such as AWS, Quicksight, Tableau etc. </p>
								<p>I then pursued a Post graduation in Data Analytics for certification in Data Analytics at Durham College, Ontario. I am currently working as Data Quality Engineer at GDI Integrated Services-Canada, where I deal with HRIS data which is quite new and challenging to me. I intend to keep this journey of mine as much of a learning experience as possible.</p>
